Bias = Error caused by wrong predictions in the learning algorhthm
Variance = Error caused by sensitivity to to small changes in the training data

Low bias is when the model over complicates the problem. For example weight and height in mice comparsions, Due to natural variation each datapoint will vary each centimeter,
So a low bias model would over complicate the problem and think every single variation due to randomness has a meaning and a pattern and would overfit the line causing it to appear
very sensitive/squiggly

A high variance model changes drasticly when small changes are made to a dataset so when using a training set with tiny differences its predictions are off
